# Examples status

In this folder we show examples of how to run the dft2kp code. Here, the jupyter files show how to read the DFT data and call our **python code** to generate the effective Hamiltonian and plot the bands. There are also subfolders for each material, these have the DFT data.

**Calculate p matrix elements via python or QE?** In each example there's a line that reads as `kp.get_p_matrices(qekp='kp.dat')`, which informs the code to read the matrix elements in `kp.dat` generated by our patched `bands.x`. If you prefer to run the original QE code and compute the p matrix elements in python (without SOC corrections), please change this line to `kp.get_p_matrices()`.

The tables below report the status of the materials we have tested in this first version. The ones ~~strikethrough~~ will be considered only after we submit the paper.

## Zincblende

The current version of the code does not work with hybrid functionals. 
We need to check how to read the data properly in this case, and test
it with GaAs to fix its gap.

## Wurtzite

In all cases we use the diagonal basis (i.e. H is diagonal in k=0).
